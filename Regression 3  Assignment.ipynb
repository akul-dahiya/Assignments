    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",

    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The value of the tuning parameter λ in Ridge Regression is typically selected using cross-validation. Here's a concise process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: Choose a range of λ values to test (e.g., from very small to large values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: For each λ, calculate the average performance metric (e.g., RMSE) across all folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal λ: Select the λ value that results in the best average performance (e.g., lowest RMSE).\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection because it shrinks coefficients but doesn't set them to zero. However, it can indicate less important features by reducing their coefficient sizes. For true feature selection, Lasso Regression is preferred, as it can eliminate features by setting some coefficients to zero."

    "Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables, but categorical variables need to be properly encoded before they can be used in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous variables can be used directly, but categorical variables, which are typically non-numeric, must be transformed into a numeric format. This is usually done through techniques like one-hot encoding, where each category is converted into a binary vector, or label encoding, where each category is assigned a unique integer.\n",

    "Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Ridge Regression, the coefficients represent the change in the predicted outcome for a unit change in the feature, with all other features held constant. A positive coefficient means the outcome increases as the feature increases, while a negative one means it decreases. Due to regularization, the coefficients are smaller than in ordinary regression, reducing the risk of overfitting. The strength of regularization (controlled by\n",
    "α) determines how much the coefficients are shrunk. Standardizing features can help compare their relative importance."

    "Lag Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Ridge Regression with time-series data, you can create lag features. Lag features are past values of the time series that serve as predictors for the future value. For example, if you're predicting the value at time \n",

    "\n",
    "Trend and Seasonality:\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to account for trends and seasonality in the data. This can be done by adding trend variables (e.g., time indices) and seasonal indicators (e.g., dummy variables for months or seasons) as features in the model.\n",

    "Stationarity:\n",
