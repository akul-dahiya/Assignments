    "Q1: Explain the following with example:\n",
    "1. Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "2. Machine Learning\n",
    "3. Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "1. Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Self driving cars, robots, alexa\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing systems that can improve their performance on a task over time with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  Email spam filters. These filters learn to identify spam emails by being trained on a large dataset of emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" Over time, the filter becomes better at recognizing spam by learning from the patterns in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze various types of data. These neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain's structure and function, enabling the system to learn complex patterns and representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Object detection, Image recognition, Chatbots, recommendation system"

    "Q2- What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means the training dataset includes both the input data and the corresponding correct output. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the model makes predictions based on input data and is corrected by comparing its predictions to the actual outputs (labels). This correction process is called \"training\" and continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location."

    "Q3- What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit outputs or labels provided. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the model tries to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data without any guidance. This is useful for exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Customer segmentation in marketing, where customers are grouped based on purchasing behavior and demographics."
