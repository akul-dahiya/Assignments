    "\n",
    "Data encoding is essential in data science because it transforms categorical data into numerical formats, making it compatible with machine learning models. It helps improve model performance, preserves valuable information, reduces dimensionality, and enables effective feature engineering."

    "\n",
    "Ans. For a dataset with 5 unique categorical values, One-Hot Encoding is typically preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding converts each categorical value into a binary vector, creating a separate column for each category. This avoids any implicit ordinal relationship and allows machine learning algorithms to handle the data effectively. For 5 unique values, this results in 5 binary columns, which is manageable and ensures that the model treats each category independently."
