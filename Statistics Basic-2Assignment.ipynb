    "Ans:  The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in the dataset and then dividing by the count of numbers. The mean is useful when you want to find the average value of a dataset. However, it can be influenced by extreme values (outliers), which can skew the result.\n",

    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the numbers are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The median is useful for skewed distributions or when there are outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. It provides a better measure of central tendency for such datasets.\n",

    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They help to understand how much the data values deviate from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode) and from each other. Here‚Äôs how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "The range provides a quick sense of the spread of the data, but it only considers the two extreme values and can be influenced by outliers.\n",
    " \n",
    "The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It gives an idea of how spread out the data points are. Variance gives a measure of how data points vary from the mean. A high variance indicates that data points are spread out over a wide range, while a low variance indicates that data points are close to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is expressed in the same units as the data, making it more interpretable.\n",
    "Standard deviation is widely used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values. It is easier to interpret than variance because it is in the same unit as the data.\n",
